# Introduction

## Map of States

```{r}
#load library
library(ggplot2)
library(maps)

#load generic usa map data
all_states <- map_data("state")
states <- subset(all_states, region %in% c( "connecticut", "maine", "massachusetts", "new hampshire", "new york", "rhode island", "vermont" ) )

#plot all states with ggplot
p <- ggplot()
p <- p + geom_polygon( data=all_states, aes(x=long, y=lat, group = group),colour="black", fill="white" )
p

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
